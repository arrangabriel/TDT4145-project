# Case 1

> A user tastes the coffee Vinterkaffe 2022 from Trondheim brewery Jacobsen & Svart (roasted 20.01.2022), gives it 10 points and writes “Wow – an odyssey for the taste buds: citrus peel, milk chocolate, apricot!”. The coffee is a light roast, natural Bourbon (c. arabica) from the farm Nombre de Dios (1500 masl) in Santa Ana, El Salvador, has a price per kilo of 600 kr and is, according to the roastery, “A tasty and complex coffee for polar nights”. The coffee was harvested in 2021 and the farm was paid 8 USD per kilo. Input on the user side is roastery, coffee name, points and notes.
